# Embedded Sentry System

## Overview
The Embedded Sentry System is an embedded project designed to monitor and track motion using gyroscopic sensors, process the raw data, and trigger responses based on predefined gestures. This system is part of the final project for the embedded systems course. The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the integration of gyroscopes with embedded systems and enable real-time gesture recognition to unlock the system.

## Features 
The system provides several key capabilities:

- Gyroscope Data Capture: Advanced sensor integration captures and processes raw motion data in real-time
- Gesture Recognition: Smart recognition system identifies predefined gestures to control system access
- Real-Time Feedback: Immediate system response to detected gestures provides seamless interaction
- Data Logging: Comprehensive logging of raw sensor data enables detailed analysis and debugging
- Configuration & Utilities: Flexible system settings and utility functions support core operations

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following key components:

- `gyro.h` / `gyro.cpp`: Core gyroscope functionality implementation including data capture and processing
- `serial_dump.py`: Python-based debugging tool for raw sensor data analysis
- `system_config.h`: Central configuration file containing system parameters and constants
- `utilities.h` / `utilities.cpp`: Common utility functions for data processing and system management

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before installing, ensure you have:

- C++ compiler (GCC or Clang)
- Python installation
- Serial communication tool (Arduino IDE or minicom)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/embedded-sentry.git
   cd embedded-sentry
   ```

2. Open the project:
   - Launch Visual Studio Code
   - Ensure PlatformIO extension is installed
   - Open the project folder

3. Build the project:
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (macOS)
   - Select "PlatformIO: Build"

4. Upload to device:
   ```bash
   pio run --target upload
   ```

## Configuration

The `system_config.h` file contains essential system parameters:

- Gesture recognition threshold values
- Gyroscope calibration settings
- System timing parameters

Modify these settings to optimize system performance for your specific use case.
